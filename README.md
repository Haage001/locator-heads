## 🎯 Advanced Player Filtering

Control which players heads appear in your locator bar:

- **All Players**  
  Show everyone. _Default_  
- **Include Only**  
  Show only specific players from your custom list.  
- **Exclude Only**  
  Hide specific players while showing everyone else.

(excluded players appear normally on the locator bar as a coloured dot)

### 🔧 Filter Configuration

- **Comma-Separated Lists**  
  Enter player names separated by commas, semicolons, colons, or periods.  
- **Non Case-Insensitive**  
  Player name matching ignores capitalization.  
- **Example**  
  ``Player1, Player2, Player3`` or ``Notch; Dinnerbone: Grumm``
